          Reference books are also kept to help students with their course studies. The cataloging and issue procedure
          in the library is through library cards. Students at St. Xaviers are encouraged not only to pursue reading but
          also to develop the art of story-telling, enacting and reading aloud.

          with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed discriptions of their ingredients help both students and
          parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student of staff member who accesses the canteen could be
          provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices
          and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for the meals online
          can ellimate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students

          <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Management
            System:
            This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student
            reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep
            a record of the studentsâ€™ absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in
            a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify
            which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual
            concepts of their curriculumâ€™s subjects. As soon as you enter a studentâ€™s Enrollment Number or Name, details
            like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible
            since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and
            powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span â€“ just after the admin
            enters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the
            educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave
            requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.</p>
